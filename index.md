## TOSCA

Stands for **T**opology and **O**rchestration **S**pecification for **C**loud **A**pplications 
It's a **standard** that can be used to enable the **portability of cloud applications and related IT services for telecom operators**.

TOSCA is a **data model** that can be used by telecom carriers for creating **templates or data descriptions of applications and infrastructure for cloud services**. 
It can also be used to define the **relationships among these services**, as well as their **operational behavior**. 
This can happen independently of the supplier creating the service or the technology infrastructure used to deliver it. 
In short, TOSCA **abstracts configuration data away from specific hardware or services** to make cloud services more interoperable and portable.
It is also being used in conjunction with other standards to deliver NFV: Notable among these is the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) management and orchestration (MANO) architecture.
TOSCA is one of many different cloud data models, including the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)’s Netconf/YANG and the TM Form’s SID
